This is my first achievement project which was to create a simple pokedex app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

This app includes the first 150 pokemon in the pokedex organized by pkedex number. The app allows the user to click on the name of the pokemon and it will display an image, type(s), and height of the pokemon.

The project also incorporated Bootstrap, JQuery, ESlint and Prettier.
